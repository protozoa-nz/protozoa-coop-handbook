# Coop sub-contracting

_Notes from a conversation between [Protozoa](http://www.protozoa.nz) and [Root Systems](http://www.rootsystems.nz)._

> Piet (Protozoa) joined a 2-person contract that Root Systems won at the start of 2017.
> The contract only lasted for a month (the client cancelled the project), but we learnt a lot about coop sub-contracting.

Voices in the room are Dan from Root Systems, and Mix and Piet from Protozoa.
We started with some general musing about working together:

Dan: 
- what does success look like in this context?
- why are we talking about this?

Mix: 
- it's really easy for working together to cost too much and be really unclear
- easy for there to be incorrect assumptions about:
  - money flows / shares
  - timelines
  - responsibility + ownership
- this can lead to breakdown of relationships
- put more positively - we want to work together: 
  - it's a smart way to do bigger things as small groups
  - absorb overflow into values aligned systems
  - reliability


Mix: can we dive into how Piet (Protozoa) worked with Root Systems?


## From the Root Systems' perspective

- we could depend on Piet as an external entity
  - self managing
- should have given clearer guidance about when Piet should escalate problems
  - "is this out of scope of my role?" > make this someone elses responsibility
- we didn't do a good job of onboarding Piet into the money side of processes:
  - specifically we need invoices within the first week after month of work, as we run on a small buffer
- we should have talked really explicitly about what our coop values
  - e.g. financial transparency!
- toggle tracking was awesome
  - time entries are connected to ticket numbers
    - this is excellent way to clarify client confusion e.g. "why is this bill so high?!"
  - github integration lets you go issues > detailed toggle entry

## From Piet's perspective

- needed a clear single point of contact
- would have loved onboarding into coop process
  - money flows 
    - am I negotiating rates or does this coop have a contractor process?
    - transaprency about money splits
      - what is this 35% : 65% split set up to fund?
        - who else is getting paid (e.g. sales)
      - what are members getting vs contractors
      - we sorted it out, but having these conversations earlier would be great for building trust
    - what guarentees are there about work?
      - minimum length (e.g. 6 weeks)
      - min / max billable hours per week
      - minimum notice of termination (e.g. not 'this project is finishing tmrw')
  - coops baseline project tools + flow
- contract with coop
- onboarding into project
  - really important to know who's holding specific roles


## Future work between coops

Mix:
- we're talking about working with a couple of coops around the world
- one of the questions we're trying to figure out, is that if each coop is trying to set aside money as a buffer, and different parties are doing different amounts of work setting a contract up, what's a reasonable way to split money?

Dan's questions: 
- how much is a lead worth?
  - I propose the value of a lead diminishes over time, or maybe should have a capped return
- what is a brand worth?
- what is a structure worth?
  - more applicable if you're a freelancer floating around

Piet:
- I think one of the coops in the UK is saving a quite diffent proportion that us

Dan:
- You can come up with radically different baselines depending on what you're assuming your employment:un-employment time looks like.
- I find as a bigger group, it's easier to assume less down time, because there's a smoothing effect from having people working on different projects.

Dan:
- With working with others, I'm a big fan of having rules up-front, so you're not constantly in negotiation

Mix: 
- are you talking about rules forged between coops OR
- internal rules e.g. minimum rates you can live on?

Dan:
- both, we have a minimum rate for sure that we will not go under
- with a split with orgs, you can split on % or peg it at a fixed amount
- if you're offering a one-time heavily discounted rate, feel free to ask for things in return



## Misc topics we covered

Conversation about a range of contracts more generally: 
- interesting to note whether the clients append terms to contracts
- MOU's seem fine for some contexts

Conversation about pod ecosystem more generally ...

Dan:
- mmm what you kinda want in a pod ecosystem is jobs around that are low earners, but are kinda dependable and values aligned. Or are the right tech-stack, or aren't soul destroying
