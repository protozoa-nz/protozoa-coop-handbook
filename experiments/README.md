# Experiments

This is a scratch-pad record of experiments we're running or have run.
They're a combination of searches for solutions to outstanding problems, or sometimes a curious jaunt into a new idea.

This is the place where we create, play, and subsequently learn.
It's a core part of our culture.

If you're interested in more detail on any of them, please get in touch (contact@protozoa.nz)
