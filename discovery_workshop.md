# Discovery Workshop

This is a design process where we aim to surface the imagined future of the app.
The purpose is to capture enough detail that we can start forming a plan of action.

We want to get software you can start interacting with in your hands within the first 2 weeks - it will start basic, but it will enable you to test your assumptions and tune the vision much more efficiently as we proceed.


Some useful prompts:
- what sort of project is this ?
  - is it a bootstrapped startup or are you taking investment and moving fast
  - do you have technical guidance or would you benefit from that?

- common risks in technical projects
  - trilema
    - knowing what you're tuning for
  - how we avoid them
